# Responsive-Portfolio
This is my Portfolio website, when you open it up it has 3 main tabs on the NavBar. The 3 pages are the Home/About. Portfolio, and the Contact page. Along the side of each page I added a social media sidebar to all of my social media links. Here is some pictues of the site below and a link.
